Smokin' out this pound, nigga, I don't smoke skinnies
Ride pass me, niggas mad 'cause my truck cost a Lamborghini
I got all this money on me, I know all these bitches see me
Gettin' top by a wanna be Lady Gaga, but she got an ass like Nicki
I'm in a party, won't you come see me
She like, "Do I gotta bring my weed with me?"
I'm like, "Hell nah, bitch, you know I be chiefin' keef"
She like, "Haha, you mean to me"
Bitch, I'm Chief Sosa Houdini
Smokin' on this greeny
This bitch thought she was independent
Tryna bring her own weed but it smell like
Oh no (oh no), oh no (oh no)
Oh no (oh no), oh no (oh no)
